**Mvt-Project-Women-LEAD-Nepal** <br>
<br>
A Django MVT web project built, while I was in Women LEAD Nepal as a LEAD course Leader <br>
and at the same time I was learning Django mvt flow so, for practice i simply made this. <br>
This project demonstrates the use of Django’s Model–View–Template architecture
 <br> combining Python, HTML, and CSS to deliver a dynamic web application. <br>

 Features <br>
1) Django MVT architecture: Clean separation of concerns with models, views, and templates. <br>
2) Dynamic content rendering: HTML templates powered by Django views. <br>
3) Python backend logic: Handles routing, data processing, and integration.<br>
4) Responsive design: Basic CSS styling for layout and presentation.<br>
5) Scalable structure: Easy to extend with new apps, models, and templates.<br>

Installation and Setup <br>
1) git clone https://github.com/Elina-codes-py/Mvt-Project-Women-LEAD-Nepal.git <br>
2) cd Mvt-Project-Women-LEAD-Nepal/mvt\ project   <br>
3) pip install django  <br>
4) python manage.py migrate  <br>
5) python manage.py runserver  <br>
